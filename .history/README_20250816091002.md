# DevChat Chat Application

DevChat is real-time chat messaging application built with React and Firebase, designed for seamless communication, responsive UI, and scalability. This project demonstrates frontend engineering, real-time backend integration, and a clear migration path to a Node/Express backend for enterprise-level scaling.

# 🚀 Features
# 🔑 Core

User authentication (Firebase Auth – email/password or social login)

Real-time one-to-one messaging (Firestore + snapshot listeners)

Responsive UI (desktop-first, mobile-friendly)

Message bubbles with timestamps

Online/offline presence (Firebase Realtime DB)

Media sharing (images, videos – Firebase Storage)

Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)

# ⚡ Advanced (Planned / In Progress)

Group chats with admin controls

Typing indicators + read receipts

Dark mode toggle

Emoji picker and reactions

Profile & settings panel

Search chats and messages

Message archiving and pinning

# 🔒 Security

Firebase Authentication (secure login flow)

Firestore security rules for data protection

Image/file storage with access rules

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend

React.js – component-based UI

CSS (Flexbox + Grid) – responsive design

Later: TailwindCSS + Framer Motion (for styling & animations)

# Backend (MVP)

Firebase Firestore – real-time database

Firebase Authentication – user auth

Firebase Storage – media file handling

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) – push notifications

Firebase Realtime Database – presence & typing status

Backend (Future Migration)

Node.js + Express – custom backend logic

Socket.IO – scalable real-time communication

Postgres/MongoDB – structured chat data storage

Redis – presence + caching

ElasticSearch – fast message search

# 🏗️ Project Architecture
## Phase 1 – Firebase MVP

React frontend connects directly to Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, FCM).

Fast to build, great for portfolio demo.

## Phase 2 – Hybrid (Firebase + Express)

Introduce Node/Express backend for business logic & scaling.

Socket.IO handles real-time messaging.

Firebase handles auth + notifications.

## Phase 3 – Enterprise Backend

Node/Express is the primary backend.

Postgres stores chat messages, Redis handles presence.

Firebase limited to Auth + Notifications.
